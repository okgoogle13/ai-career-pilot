## **\#\#STAR-Methodology KSC Responses**

### **\#\#\#KSC for Housing Support Worker (Persona A)**

Situation: In my role as a Housing Support Worker at City Outreach Mission, I was responsible for a caseload of approximately 15-20 clients experiencing complex challenges, including primary homelessness, chronic health issues, and histories of trauma.  
Task: My core task was to provide holistic, end-to-end case management to build trust, assess needs, develop client-led case plans, and connect clients to services to help them secure and maintain stable housing.  
Action: I used an assertive outreach model to engage clients, conducted comprehensive biopsychosocial assessments, and collaborated with each client to create an Individual Support Plan. I actively advocated for my clients with services like Centrelink and Specialist Homelessness Services (SHS) and meticulously documented all interactions in the Client Management System (CMS).  
Result: Through this approach, I successfully supported 8 clients in moving from primary homelessness into long-term accommodation over one year. My detailed case files ensured continuity of care, leading to a 95% client engagement rate and positive feedback from management.

### **\#\#\#KSC for Housing Support Worker (Complex Case)**

Situation: During my role as Housing Support Worker at Inner City Housing Service, I was assigned a complex case involving Sarah, a 34-year-old woman experiencing chronic homelessness with co-occurring mental health challenges and a history of domestic violence.  
Task: My responsibility was to provide comprehensive case management that addressed Sarah's immediate safety needs while building her capacity for sustainable housing, requiring coordination of multiple services and a trauma-informed approach.  
Action: I began with client-led engagement, meeting Sarah where she felt safe. I conducted psychosocial assessments using a strengths-based approach and coordinated with mental health, domestic violence, and housing specialists. I researched pet-friendly accommodation to accommodate her companion dog, a key stabilizing factor. I provided practical support with Centrelink applications and court accompaniment, maintaining detailed case notes and weekly risk assessments.  
Result: After 4 months of intensive case management, Sarah successfully transitioned to stable community housing with ongoing support. Her mental health stabilized, and six months post-housing, she remained stably housed and had begun volunteering.

### **\#\#\#KSC for AOD Peer Support Worker (Persona B)**

Situation: While working as an AOD Peer Support Worker, I frequently encountered clients new to the service who were ambivalent about recovery and distrustful of professionals, making initial engagement a significant challenge.  
Task: My task was to leverage my own lived experience of recovery to bridge this gap, build rapport, and inspire hope, thereby increasing their willingness to engage with the centre's clinical programs.  
Action: I employed intentional, purposeful self-disclosure with supervisor guidance. If a client shared a specific struggle, I would share a brief, relevant, and resolved aspect of my own journey, framing it as a shared experience rather than advice. I always maintained strict professional boundaries, ensuring disclosures were client-focused and aimed at normalising their experience.  
Result: This peer-based approach led to a 40% higher retention rate for new clients who engaged with a Peer Worker in their first month. Clients frequently reported that connecting with someone with lived experience was a "turning point" that made them feel less alone.

### **\#\#\#KSC for AOD Peer Support Worker (Complex Case)**

Situation: As a Peer Support Worker at Recovery Pathways Centre, I encountered James, a 28-year-old entering residential rehab for methamphetamine dependence. He expressed significant shame and was resistant to engaging with clinical staff, requesting to speak with someone who "actually understood."  
Task: My role was to provide peer support drawing appropriately on my lived experience while maintaining professional boundaries, helping James feel understood and supporting his engagement with the broader treatment team.  
Action: I began by sharing appropriately boundaried aspects of my own recovery, focusing on universal themes like shame and the difficulty of asking for help. I used my lived experience to normalize his feelings while gently challenging hopelessness. I modeled how to engage constructively with clinical staff and regularly debriefed with my supervisor to ensure my own recovery remained protected.  
Result: Over 6 weeks, James transitioned from reluctant participant to active engagement in his treatment program. He later shared that having someone who "got it" without judgment was crucial to his willingness to be vulnerable. He successfully completed the 12-week program.

### **\#\#\#KSC for Community Project Officer (Persona C)**

Situation: As a Community Services Project Officer, I was part of a team delivering the "Youth Connect" program. The program was approaching its end-of-financial-year reporting deadline, which was critical for securing ongoing funding.  
Task: My task was to support the Project Manager in all aspects of administration and reporting, including coordinating stakeholder meetings, drafting communications, collating program data, and contributing to the final report.  
Action: I developed a detailed project timeline, scheduled and minuted all stakeholder meetings, and ensured action items were distributed promptly. I collated all program data from our CRM, including attendance and feedback, and presented this data using clear charts. I then drafted the initial sections of the final report for the Project Manager's review.  
Result: Due to my systematic organisation, the team submitted a high-quality, data-rich report two days ahead of the deadline. The report was commended by the funding body, and the program's funding was successfully renewed for the following two years.
